## Session Setup: 2026-05-31 (staging)

**Phase:** Staging complete
**Plan:** `docs/plans/elves-run-2-full-parity.md`
**Survival guide:** `docs/elves/survival-guide.md`
**Learnings:** `docs/elves/learnings.md` (run #1 L1–L11 preserved)
**Execution log:** `docs/elves/execution-log.md`
**Branch:** `feat/full-parity`
**Worktree:** `/Users/johnennis/aigora/dev/FactoMinePy-full-parity` (dedicated, per elves ≥1.11.0)
**Baseline:** `origin/docs/run-2-full-parity-plan` (run #1 code + the run-2 plan), tip `19c448b`. NOT `main` — PR #3 (run #1) is unmerged, so main lacks FAMD/GPA/plotly that MFA builds on. The run-2 PR stacks on the plan branch and retargets to main as PR #3 → #4 merge.
**Run mode:** finite, very large budget ("don't care how long"). **Merge:** never (user merges).

**Batch breakdown (6 phases, ~22 batches):**
- A1 MFA core · A2 MFA completeness · A3 HMFA · A4 DMFA
- B1 FAMD sup vars · B2 MCA sup-block parity + Burt · B3 GPA edge cases · B4 missing values + row weights · B5 dimdesc CA/MCA
- C1 predict.* · C2 reconst + estim_ncp · C3 descfreq
- D1 CaGalt · D2 regression family · D3 textual · D4 utility exports
- E1 plots for new methods · E2 plot helpers (autoLab/plotellipses/ellipseCA) · E3 ggplot (likely out of scope)
- F1 release

**Preflight (in the worktree):**
- venv created + `pip install -e '.[dev]'` (incl. plotly): PASS (`factominer 0.2.0.dev0` imports).
- `pytest -q`: PASS — **123 passed, 2 skipped** (baseline; matches run #1's final state).
- `ruff check factominer tests`: clean.
- `gh auth status`: logged in (`john-aigora`), scopes include `repo` + `workflow`.
- caffeinate: recommend the user run `caffeinate -d -i -m -s &` for long unattended stretches.
- R: NOT installed locally — fixtures go through the `rpy2-parity` CI workflow_dispatch loop.
- PyPI trusted publisher already bound (from v0.2.0.dev0); the F1 release tag will auto-publish.

**Launch readiness:** READY. Stop allowed right now: NO.

**Launch prompt:**
> /elves docs/plans/elves-run-2-full-parity.md
>
> The run is staged. Worktree /Users/johnennis/aigora/dev/FactoMinePy-full-parity,
> branch feat/full-parity (collision tripwire 19c448b). Session artifacts under
> docs/elves/. Work ONLY in that worktree on that branch. Start with Batch A1
> (MFA core). R is not installed locally — fixtures go through the rpy2-parity CI
> workflow_dispatch loop. Parity bar + stop conditions are in the plan. Never merge.
